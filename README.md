PySimulator
===========

The environment provides a graphical user interface for simulating different
model types (currently Functional Mockup Units and Modelica Models), plotting
result variables and applying simulation result analysis tools like Fast Fourier
Transform. Additionally advanced tools for linear system analysis are provided
that can be applied to the automatically linearized models. The modular concept
of the software enables easy development of further plugins for both simulation
and analysis.

Supported Platforms: Windows
