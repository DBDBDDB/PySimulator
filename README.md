PySimulator
===========

The environment provides a graphical user interface for simulating different
model types (currently Functional Mockup Units, Modelica Models and SimulationX
Models), plotting result variables and applying simulation result analysis tools
like Fast Fourier Transform. Additionally advanced tools for linear system
analysis are provided that can be applied to the automatically linearized models.
The modular concept of the software enables easy development of further plugins
for both simulation and analysis.
